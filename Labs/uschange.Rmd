# Income

```{r}
library(fpp2)
income=uschange[,"Income"]
autoplot(income)
```


We see no trend and no seasonal pattern... We can check the ACF 
```{r}
ggAcf(income)
ggPacf(income)
```

It seems to be no correlation or auto-correlation... 
We can check that with a Box.test:
```{r}
Box.test(income,lag=10,type="Ljung-Box")
```

Indeed, no reason to reject the fact that it is a white noise : there is nothing to forecast in this series !!

# Income

```{r}
library(fpp2)
unemp=uschange[,"Unemployment"]
autoplot(unemp)
Box.test(unemp,lag=10,type="Ljung-Box")
ggAcf(unemp)
ggPacf(unemp)
```

Maybe an $AR_8$ ?

```{r}
ar8=Arima(unemp,order=c(8,0,0))
```

We can check the residual
```{r}
checkresiduals(ar8)
```

The residual are a white noise, we can keep this model for our forecast.

```{r}
autoplot(forecast(ar8,h=10))
```
